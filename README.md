## IITB Superscalar Processor - CS683 Course Project (Autumn 2022)

### Course Instructor - Prof. Virendra Singh
------
## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to enhance a 6-Staged Pipeline to an Inorder-Superscalar processor while effectively managing hazards. By implementing Registration Station and Branch Prediction methods, the goal was to achieve a unit CPI (Clocks Per Instruction) for improved performance.
## Features
* Upgraded a 6-Staged Pipeline to an Inorder-Superscalar Processor.
* Implemented Registration Stations for hazard control and improved execution efficiency.
* Utilized Branch Prediction techniques to enhance the accuracy of branch outcomes.
* Simulated the microprocessor model designed on MAX V FPGA using Quartus and ModelSim.
